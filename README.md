Antirush plugin that forces the entire team of survivors to cooperate to complete the level.
Saferoom doors are blocked, when a player tries to open it the scavenge will begin.
Players must fill the generator with the required amount of gascans.
When the generator is filled, door will be unlocked and players will be able to pass to the next level.
Plugin includes an editor to allow server admins to customize the generator and gascan positions.
Plugin includes a generic config for maps to block saferoom door.
Not all maps have door blocked. I have not blocked doors in maps that have a final mini-gauntlet event like the rollercoaster in Dark Carnival, or the church holdout in Death Toll. If you want to block these saferoom doors, do it by yourself and don't ask me to do that.
This plugins supports translations (currently english and spanish).
